Overview 
This document contains Responsible AI Framework, a comprehensive governance, risk, and oversight model designed to guide organisations in the safe, ethical, and compliant adoption of AI systems.
This framework integrates global standards such as:
•	NIST AI RMF
•	ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management System)
•	OECD AI Principles
•	Microsoft, Google & Meta Responsible AI practices

1.	Responsible AI Principles

1.1	Human-Centered Design
1.2	Ethical Data Use
1.3	Transparency & Traceability
1.4	Safety & Security by Design
1.5	Responsible Deployment
1.6	Continuous Monitoring & Auditability
1.7	Accountability & Governance Alignment

2.	AI Governance Structure

2.1	Strategic Governance Layer 
•	AI Governance Board
•	RAI Executive Sponsor
•	CISO / Legal / Compliance
•	Ethics Review Teams
2.2	Tactical Governance Layer
•	AI Program Manager
•	AI Risk Manager
•	Data Stewards
•	Model Owners
2.3	Operational Layer
•	Data Scientists
•	ML Engineers
•	MLOps & Monitoring Teams

3.	AI Model Lifecycle

3.1.	GOVERN
•	Use case classification
•	Ethical/legal review
•	Data access governance
•	Approval workflows
3.2.	MAP

3.3.	MEASURE
•	Fairness testing
•	Explainability evaluation
•	Adversarial robustness
•	Privacy & security testing
3.4.	MANAGE
•	Deployment guardrails
•	Monitoring (drift, misuse, performance)
•	Incident response
•	Audit cycles & retraining

4.	Responsible AI Controls Catalogue

4.1.	Data Controls
•	Data minimisation
•	Provenance validation
•	Bias detection
•	Consent governance

4.2.	Model Controls

•	Access management
•	Logging & anomaly detection
4.4.	Deployment Controls
•	Deployment gates
•	Rollback strategy
•	Versioning
•	Reproducibility
4.5.	Monitoring Controls
•	Drift alerts

•	SLA tracking
4.6.	Organizational & Governance Controls
•	RACI for AI roles
•	Audit readiness
•	Compliance mapping
•	Governance decisions

5.	AI RISK SCORING MODEL
Risk Score = Impact * Likelihood * Detectability (Produces a Red-Amber-Green Risk Matrix)

5.1.	Impact Dimensions
•	Harm to individuals
•	Financial risk
•	Legal/regulatory exposure
•	Security impact
•	Reputational harm
5.2.	Likelihood Dimensions
•	Bias probability
•	Data vulnerability
•	Model instability
•	Attack feasibility
5.3.	Detectability
•	Ease of identifying anomalies
•	Monitoring strength
